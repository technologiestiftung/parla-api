Er ist gleichwohl bemüht, Ihnen eine Antwort auf Ihre Anfrage zukommen zu lassen und hat daher das Bezirksamt Pankow um Stellungnahme gebeten, die von dort in eigener Verantwortung erstellt und dem Senat übermittelt wurde. Sie wird in der Antwort an den entsprechend gekennzeichneten Stellen wiedergegeben.   Frage 1:   Wie ist der Arbeitsstand bei der Umsetzung der Forderung aus dem § 19 des Berliner Klimaschutzund Energiewendegesetzes (EWG Bln), auf Dächern öffentlicher Gebäude spätestens bis zum 31. Dezember 2024 Solaranlagen auf der gesamten technisch nutzbaren Dachfläche zu errichten, im Bezirk Pankow?   Antwort zu 1:   Das Bezirksamt Pankow teilt hierzu mit: „Bei allen Maßnahmen werden entsprechende Vorbereitungen für eine nachträgliche Installation einer PV-Anlage (PV-Readiness) geplant und innerhalb eines Jahres nach Bauabnahme werden die entsprechend geeigneten Dachflächen mit einer Solaranlage versehen. Vereinzelte Maßnahmen werden bereits mit einer PV-Anlage geplant, so dass mit der Bauabnahme auch die PV-Anlage in Betrieb genommen ist.“    ',

Es gibt etwa 257 solcher Gebäude im Bezirk Pankow. Das Bezirksamt ist für die Umsetzung der Solarpflicht zuständig, aber es gibt auch andere öffentliche Einrichtungen, die Gebäude im Bezirk betreiben und unter die Solarpflicht fallen. Die genaue Größe der Dachflächen ist derzeit nicht bekannt, aber bisher wurden etwa 29.000 m² mit Solaranlagen belegt.
